## React Context

## HTML Forms

- The <form> element itself is a shell or container that doesn't have any visual impact.
- We then fill the form with a collection of inputs, checkboxes, buttons, etc.
- The form element "represents a document section containing interactive controls for submitting informaton.
- The action attribute specifies where the form data is sent.
- The method attribute specifies which HTTP method should be used (don't worry about this for now)

### input

- The input element is used to create a variety of different form controls.
- We have 20+ possible types of inputs, ranging from date pickers to checkboxes.
- The type attribute is where the magic happens. Changing type dramatically alters the input's behavior and appearance.
